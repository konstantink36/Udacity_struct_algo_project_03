Problem 4:
Given an input array consisting on only 0, 1, and 2, sort the array in a single traversal (Dutch National flag problem)

Implemented a counting sort method, that counts the occurances of each number and uses this to create a sorted array.
This requires only one traversal and does not need extra space.

Time Complexity: O(n)
Space Complexity: O(1)
