Problem 1: 
Find the floored square root of a number. For example if the given number is 16, then the answer would be 4.

Implemented with iterative binary search.
Square x * x of a number increases monotonically, so the probblem can be solved with binary search.
Binary search has better time complexity O(log n) than linear search (O(n).

Time Complexity: O(log n)
Space Complexity: O(1)
