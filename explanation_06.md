Problem 6:
Find Maximum and Minimum Element in array. 

Implemented with divide and conquer method.
The array is divided into two halves, then using recursive approach to find maximum and mimum numbers in each half.
Then find the maximum of the two maxima of each half and the mimimum of two minima of each half.
Time complexity of Divide and Conquer method is O(log n), which is much faster than linear search (O(n)).

Time complexity: O( log n)
Space complexity: O(log n) for recursion call stack
