Problem 7:
HTTPRouter using a Trie.
The purpose of an HTTP Router is to take a URL path like "/", "/about", or "/blog/2019-01-15/my-awesome-blog-post" and figure out what content to return. 

Implemented with Trie structure as in problem 5.

Time complexity of a Trie data structure for insertion, deletion and search operation is O(n) where n is length of a search string.
Space complexity of a Trie data structure is O(N*M*C) where N is the number of strings and M is the highest length of the string and C is the size of the alphabet.
