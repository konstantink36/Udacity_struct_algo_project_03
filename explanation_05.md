Problem 5:
Trie structure to store dynamic set of strings and with the ability to list suffixes to implement an autocomplete feature.
For example, if our Trie contains the words ["fun", "function", "factory"] and we ask for suffixes from the f node, we would expect to receive ["un", "unction", "actory"]

Time complexity of a Trie data structure for insertion, deletion and search operation is O (n) where n is length of a search string.
Space complexity of a Trie data structure is O (N*M*C) where N is the number of strings and M is the highest length of the string and C is the size of the alphabet.
